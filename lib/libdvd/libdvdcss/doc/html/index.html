Introduction</h1>
<p><em>libdvdcss</em> is a simple library designed for accessing DVDs like a block device without having to bother about the decryption. The important features are: </p>
<ul>
<li>portability: currently supported platforms are GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BeOS, Windows 98/ME, Windows NT/2000/XP, Mac OS X, Solaris, HP-UX and OS/2. </li>
<li>adaptability: unlike most similar projects, libdvdcss doesn't require the region of your drive to be set and will try its best to read from the disc even in the case of a region mismatch. </li>
<li>simplicity: a DVD player can be built around the <em>libdvdcss</em> API using no more than 4 or 5 library calls.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>libdvdcss</em> is free software, released under the General Public License. This ensures that <em>libdvdcss</em> remains free and used only with free software.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="api"></a>
The libdvdcss API</h1>
<p>The complete <em>libdvdcss</em> programming interface is documented in the <a class="el" href="dvdcss_8h.html" title="The libdvdcss public header. ">dvdcss.h</a> file.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="env"></a>
Environment variables</h1>
<p>Some environment variables can be used to change the behavior of <em>libdvdcss</em> without having to modify the program which uses it. These variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DVDCSS_VERBOSE:</b> sets the verbosity level.<ul>
<li><code>0</code> outputs no messages at all.</li>
<li><code>1</code> outputs error messages to stderr.</li>
<li><code>2</code> outputs error messages and debug messages to stderr.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>DVDCSS_METHOD:</b> sets the authentication and decryption method that <em>libdvdcss</em> will use to read scrambled discs. Can be one of <code>title</code>, <code>key</code> or <code>disc</code>.<ul>
<li><code>key</code> is the default method. <em>libdvdcss</em> will use a set of calculated player keys to try and get the disc key. This can fail if the drive does not recognize any of the player keys.</li>
<li><code>disc</code> is a fallback method when <code>key</code> has failed. Instead of using player keys, <em>libdvdcss</em> will crack the disc key using a brute force algorithm. This process is CPU intensive and requires 64 MB of memory to store temporary data.</li>
<li><code>title</code> is the fallback when all other methods have failed. It does not rely on a key exchange with the DVD drive, but rather uses a crypto attack to guess the title key. On rare cases this may fail because there is not enough encrypted data on the disc to perform a statistical attack, but in the other hand it is the only way to decrypt a DVD stored on a hard disc, or a DVD with the wrong region on an RPC2 drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>DVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE:</b> specify the raw device to use. Exact usage will depend on your operating system, the Linux utility to set up raw devices is <code>raw(8)</code> for instance. Please note that on most operating systems, using a raw device requires highly aligned buffers: Linux requires a 2048 bytes alignment (which is the size of a DVD sector).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>DVDCSS_CACHE:</b> specify a directory in which to store title key values. This will speed up descrambling of DVDs which are in the cache. The DVDCSS_CACHE directory is created if it does not exist, and a subdirectory is created named after the DVD's title or manufacturing date. If DVDCSS_CACHE is not set or is empty, <em>libdvdcss</em> will use the default value which is "${HOME}/.dvdcss/" under Unix and "C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\Application Data\dvdcss\" under Win32. The special value "off" disables caching. </li>
</ul>
